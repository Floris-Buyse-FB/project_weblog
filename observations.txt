Based on the precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, it appears that the model is 
performing better at identifying humans than robots, which is aligned with the objective of minimizing 
the number of humans that are mistakenly classified as robots.

The 98% precision for humans indicates that only a small proportion of human visitors are being mistakenly 
classified as robots, while the 99% recall for humans indicates that the model is identifying most of the 
human visitors correctly. Similarly, the F1-score for humans is also high at 98%, indicating that the model 
is performing well at identifying humans without sacrificing too much precision or recall.

For robots, the 94% precision indicates that there is a higher chance of a 
false positive (i.e., classifying a human as a robot), which is undesirable. However, the 92% recall for robots 
indicates that the model is still identifying most of the actual robots correctly. The F1-score for robots is 
93%, which is lower than the score for humans but still indicates that the model is performing well at identifying 
robots without sacrificing too much precision or recall.

Overall, the metrics suggest that the model is performing well at identifying humans while still 
maintaining a relatively high performance in detecting robots.
